    "In this chapter, we’ll explore Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, where the main principle is to “**think first, answer later.**” This approach encourages Solar to break down problems logically and solve them in, rather than jumping directly to a conclusion. CoT is especially effective for multi-step math problems and complex reasoning tasks, as it guides the model to consider each part of the problem individually, building up to a coherent solution."
