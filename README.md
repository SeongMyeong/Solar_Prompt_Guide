## Hello!
**Upstage's the Prompt Engineering Cookbook.**

Prompting serves as a cohesive natural language interface for human-AI interactions and has gained widespread adoption in the era of large language models (LLMs). LLMs are particularly sensitive to prompt design. This cookbook aims to provide a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for crafting highly effective prompts within Solar Pro Preview, emphasizing practical techniques and strategies. At the core of this course is the concept of a prompt engineering cookbook, which offers a collection of structured recipes outlining best practices for prompt creation. These recipes present proven methods to optimize interactions with solar models, addressing common challenges and providing frameworks for various use cases.

By the end of this book, **you will be able to:** 

1. Develop a solid foundation in prompt structure.
2. Find solutions to resolve common difficulties to maximize prompt engineering by using solar pro model.
3. Gain a deep understanding of Solar's capabilities and limitations.
4. Create optimized prompts from scratch for variety of common applications.

## Some of you may wonder when to use prompt engineering versus fine-tuning. Here’s a quick guide on each: 

Use *prompt engineering* when: 
- You need fliexibility, fast iteration, and cost efficiency. 
- Tasks are general or the model is instruction-tuned.
- Requirements may change often. 

Use *fine-tuning* when: 
- Tasks are specilized or domain-speicific. 
- Consistency, accuracy, and scalability are critical.
- Base model lacks necessasry knowledge. 

Start with prompt engineering; move to fine-tuning if results are inconsistent or too complex to handle with prompts alone.
